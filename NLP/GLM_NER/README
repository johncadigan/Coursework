Global Linear Model Named Entity Recognition


Files:

GLM_NER.py: This has the tagger (GLM_NER) as well as a feature object (Feature) for feature vector operations.
trained_v: This is the optimized weight vector and can be loaded while running the program.
gene.train: This is the training data
gene.dev: This is the development data
eval_gene_tagger.py: This will evaluate the tagger
output: The output from training 10 times; it has an F1 score of .589

Instructions:

Run the tagger:

$python GLM_NER.py gene.train 5 (# of iterations) gene.dev

###It is highly recommended to use pypy

Evaluate the results:
$python eval_gene_tagger.py gene.key output
