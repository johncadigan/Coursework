Hidden Markov Model Name-Entity Recognition Tagger

Files:

HMM_tager.py: this program uses the Viterbi algorithm with hidden Markov models to label genes from a selection of the biocreative corpus; accuracy is improved by relpacing rare tokens with classes of tokens (Numeric tokens, all-capital tokens, tokens ending in a capital letter, and generic rare tokens)
gene.counts: Has counts of tags for individual tokens as well as unigrams, bigrams and trigrams of tags
gene.dev: The development corpus
gene.key: The key for that corpus
output: The output from running the program; it has an F1 score of .416
eval_gene_tagger.py: Evaluates program's F1 score by comparing output to the key

Instructions:

To tag a text file:
$python HMM_tagger.py training.counts text_file > output

To evaluate with a given key:
$python eval_gene_tagger.py key output
