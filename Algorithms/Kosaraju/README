Kosaraju's Strongly Connected Components Algorithm:

Files: Rec_SCC_Kosaraju.py runs a recursive implementation of the algorithm. Due to the way Python runs, you need to increase the stack size for it to run. You can do this with:
$ulimit -s 32000
SCC.txt: The information for a directed graph
SCC_Kosaraju.py: An implementation with an iterative DFS search instead of a recursive one which removes the necessity of increasing the stack size and recursion limit. This is close to working, but will not work with the current file.




Instructions:

Increase stack size:
$ulimit -s 32000

Run the program (pypy would be better):
$ python Rec_SCC_Kosaraju.py SCC.txt
