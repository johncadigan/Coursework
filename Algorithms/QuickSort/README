Count_QS.py contains quicksort with 3 different partition methods, choosing the first, the last and the median of the first, middle and last. It will output the respective computations for each given a file with one number (not repeated) on each line.
It should be noted that the median routine does not include the comparisons used to calculate the median.


Instructions:

$python Count_QS.py Count_QS.dat
