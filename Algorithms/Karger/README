Karger Min Cut


This is an implementation of the Karger minimum cut algorithm. It takes an adjacency list as input and outputs the minimum number of edges to cut through a graph. It works by randomly choosing vertices to combine and then counting the edges once there are only two vertices left. It must run for a number of iterations. For the current data, it will usually output the correct result with 50 iterations.

Instructions:

$python KargerMinCut.py KargerMinCut.dat

Please input the number of iterations: 50
